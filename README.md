# cat-fetch
A cute, minimal fetch made in C [as my first C program]

# Building
To build, you can use `gcc` (make sure you are in the same folder as the file!):

```
gcc cat_fetch.c -o cat-fetch
```
To use this without writing the path to the compiled binary every time, you can move it to `/bin/` using `sudo`:
```
sudo mv cat-fetch /bin/
```

after that, you can run catfetch with `cat-fetch` or whatever your compiled binary name was.
